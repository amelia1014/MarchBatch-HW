Answer following questions
1.	What is View? What are the benefits of using views?

a view is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. 
This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary.
Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table. Consequently, a view can limit the degree of exposure of the underlying tables to the outer world: a given user may have permission to query the view, while denied access to the rest of the base table.
Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table.

2.	Can data be modified through views?
No

3.	What is stored procedure and what are the benefits of using it?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again
The procedure calls are quick and efficient as stored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form.Hence the response is quick. 
The executable code is automatically cached, hence lowers the memory requirements.
Since the same piece of code is used again and again so, it results in higher productivity.
To create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.

4.	What is the difference between view and stored procedure?
View is simple showcasing data stored in the database tables whereas a stored procedure is a group of statements that can be executed. 

5.	What is the difference between stored procedure and functions?
A function has a return type and returns a value.
A procedure does not have a return type. But it returns values using the OUT parameters.

6.	Can stored procedure return multiple result sets?
Yes

7.	Can stored procedure be executed as part of SELECT Statement? Why?
A procedure can return multiple result sets, each with its own schema. It's not suitable for using in a SELECT statement.

8.	What is Trigger? What types of Triggers are there?
trigger is a special type of stored procedures that is automatically executed when an event occurs in a specific database server. 
SQL Server provides us with two main types of triggers: the DML Triggers and the DDL triggers

9.	What are the scenarios to use Triggers?
10.	What is the difference between Trigger and Stored Procedure?
Write queries for following scenarios
Use Northwind database. All questions are based on assumptions described by the Database Diagram sent to you yesterday. When inserting, make up info if necessary. Write query for each step. Do not use IDE. BE CAREFUL WHEN DELETING DATA OR DROPPING TABLE.
1.	Lock tables Region, Territories, EmployeeTerritories and Employees. Insert following information into the database. In case of an error, no changes should be made to DB.
a.	A new region called “Middle Earth”;
b.	A new territory called “Gondor”, belongs to region “Middle Earth”;
c.	A new employee “Aragorn King” who's territory is “Gondor”.
2.	Change territory “Gondor” to “Arnor”.
3.	Delete Region “Middle Earth”. (tip: remove referenced data first) (Caution: do not forget WHERE or you will delete everything.) In case of an error, no changes should be made to DB. Unlock the tables mentioned in question 1.
4.	Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
5.	Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accept product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.
6.	Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accept product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.
7.	Lock tables Region, Territories, EmployeeTerritories and Employees. Create a stored procedure “sp_move_employees_[your_last_name]” that automatically find all employees in territory “Tory”; if more than 0 found, insert a new territory “Stevens Point” of region “North” to the database, and then move those employees to “Stevens Point”.
8.	Create a trigger that when there are more than 100 employees in territory “Stevens Point”, move them back to Troy. (After test your code,) remove the trigger. Move those employees back to “Troy”, if any. Unlock the tables.
9.	Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.
10.	 Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. (Make a screen shot) drop the table. Employee table should not be affected.
11.	Create a stored procedure named “sp_your_last_name_1” that returns all cites that have at least 2 customers who have bought no or only one kind of product. Create a stored procedure named “sp_your_last_name_2” that returns the same but using a different approach. (sub-query and no-sub-query).
12.	How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
14.
First Name	Last Name	Middle Name
John	Green	
Mike	White	M
Output should be
Full Name
John Green
Mike White M.
Note: There is a dot after M when you output.
15.
Student	Marks	Sex
Ci	70	F
Bob	80	M
Li	90	F
Mi	95	M
Find the top marks of Female students.
If there are to students have the max score, only output one.
16.
Student	Marks	Sex
Li	90	F
Ci	70	F
Mi	95	M
Bob	80	M
How do you out put this?
